# ACME

**THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED IN PRODUCTION!**

This was a project for the lecture "Network Security HS2020" at ETH Zurich.
It implements a ACMEv2 client according to [RFC8555](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555) and supports DNS and HTTP challenges.
The client will create a DNS or HTTP server to fulfill the challenges.
Check the code to see on which ports these servers will bind to.
